#  Why should I trust you?

Despite widespread adoption, mission critical industries remain dependent on 'black-box' ML approaches. This project will help you investigate methods that can shed some light into the decision making process of classifiers and allow you to experiment with such methods in realistic datasets.

## Tasks

1. Wrire a 4 page tutorial on LIME method as described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938). (20 points)
2. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) and replicate the results in [`multi_polatiry_books` dataset](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/) with `random_forest` algorithms.  (20 points)
3. Apply a classifier of your choice to the [Tubespam dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YouTube+Spam+Collection) that was used in [this paper.](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/papers/TCA_ICMLA15.pdf) (20 points)
4. Apply the LIME explainer on the classifier you implemented in the previous step for the Tubespam dataset and write a 2 page summary with your findings (40 points)

You can use Colab for this project and you must submit a Github repo. Write up tasks can be either embedded in the notebook or in separated markdown and images files.
