# Pneumonia 

## Introduction
Pneumonia accounts for over 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old internationally. In 2015, 920,000 children under the age of 5 died from the disease. In the United States, pneumonia accounts for over 500,000 visits to emergency departments and over 50,000 deaths in 2015 , keeping the ailment on the list of top 10 causes of death in the country.

## Competition Details
In this [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/kernels), youâ€™re challenged to build an algorithm to detect a visual signal for pneumonia in medical images. Specifically, your algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs.

## Writeup
The final project should be accompanied with a writeup.md / README.md file that extensively describes each step of execution, the model and why every single model and parameter choice was made. The write up should be written as a **tutorial** and an equal weight will be applied between the writeup and the acurracy metric (50%). The best team tutorial will be selected for presentation during the last class and will be given a 20%  boost in project grade.  The second best tutorial will be given a 10% boost in project grade. The best way to write a tutorial is iterative - start early and constantly expand each section as time allows until the deadline. 

No project will be graded unless it runs with no errors in colab. You will be granted only a 24h extension to correct any issues in such unlikely event.
