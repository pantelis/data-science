# Accelerated Functional Programming - The case for Jax

![](images/jax_logo_250px.png)

## Description

This project will run under the supervision of the Prof involves (re)coding a number notebooks from TF/Pytorch  into Google's Jax from scratch in combination of other known functional libraries such as Flax, Optax, Deep Mind Haiku and others .  

JAX is an extensible system for composable function transformations and you can read its groundbraking benefits for a wide range of scientific applications [here](https://github.com/google/jax)

## Deliverables

Input: Each student will be given a number of notebooks.

Output: Tutorial MyST (markdown) plus Python code that showcases each concept. Or Small self-contained applications in Plotly Dash that showcase how the Jax-based code can be used in an app setting.
