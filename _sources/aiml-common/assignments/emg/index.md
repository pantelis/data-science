# Electromyography and Gradient Boosting 

In this assignment you will expand on the Gradient Boosting ensemble prediction method [you saw in class](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lewtun/hepml/blob/master/notebooks/lesson04_intro-to-gradient-boosting.ipynb) by coding it from scratch

## Background and Documentation (30 points)

Make sure you go through [this](https://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/),  [this](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kashnitsky/topic-10-gradient-boosting/notebook) and [this](https://www.gormanalysis.com/blog/gradient-boosting-explained/) excellent writeups. Summarise the technique including the equations in a markdown file or notebook. 

## Coding from scratch using JAX (30 points)

![](clipped-cos-dataset.png)

Using libraries from the JAX ecosystem, code gradient boosting from scratch using the clipped cosinusoidal dataset for [the classification task](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kashnitsky/topic-10-gradient-boosting?scriptVersionId=37852307&cellId=15).

Apply your gradient boosting implementation to the [EMG dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EMG+Physical+Action+Data+Set) - for a demonstration of a similar application see [this tutorial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3885826/)

**Every student that publishes this assignment as a tutorial on their [Medium](https://medium.com/) account will receive 5 additional points before the letter course grade is determined at the end of the semester. Link your published article in your github repo README.md file.**
