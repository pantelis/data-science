    "1. We monitor server faults in a data center over a period of T units of time and represents each occurring fault as a point on the line. What is the probability that k faults take place between $t_1$ and $t_2$ if $n$ total points were recorded ?  (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We collected a very large set of faults $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ over a long measurement interval $T \\rightarrow \\infty$  and we observed that on average faults occur with a rate of $\\lambda = \\frac{n}{T}$.   This [allows us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_limit_theorem) to model the probability of $k_a$ points in an interval $t_a$ as [Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution).  Suppose that we measure $k_a$ and $k_b$ faults in two consecutive intervals of durations $t_a=(t_1, t_2)$ and $t_b=(t_2, t_3)$ respectively where $t_a+t_b < T$, write the expression of the joint probability $$p(k_a \\in t_a, k_b \\in t_b)$$. (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Suppose now that we need to schedule personnel to replace these servers and we are interested to use the fault data to estimate the probability of $$p(k_a \\in t_a | k_c \\in t_c)$$ where $t_c=t_a + t_b$. Write the expression of this conditional probability.  (10 points)"
