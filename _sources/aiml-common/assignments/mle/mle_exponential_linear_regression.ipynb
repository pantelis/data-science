    "**What is the exponential distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential distribution is a probability distribution that describes time between events in a Poisson process. There is a strong relationship between the Poisson distribution and the Exponential distribution. For example, let’s say a Poisson distribution models the number of births in a given time period. The time in between each birth can be modeled with an exponential distribution (Young & Young, 1998).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poisson vs Exponential?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say a Youtube channel is interested in the number of views per hour. Arrivals per hour has a Poisson 120 arrival rate, which means that 120 viewers arrive per hour. This could also be said that “The expected mean inter-arrival time is 0.5 minutes”, because a viewer can be expected every 1/2 minute (30 seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential distribution models this process, so we could write:\n",
    "Poisson 120 = Exponential 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "The units for the Poisson process are viewers and the units for the exponential are minutes.\n",
