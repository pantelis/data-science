# Learning Examples

## Supervised Learning

A couple of examples of supervised learning are shown below:

*Zillow predicts prices for similar homes in the same market. This is a regression problem.*

## Semi-supervised Learning 

Semi-supervised learning stands between the supervised and unsupervised methods. In semi-supervised learning we combine a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. Semi-supervised learning can be achieved with either inductive or _transductive learning_. Transduction was introduced by Vladimir Vapnik in the 1990s, motivated by his view that transduction is preferable to induction since, according to him, induction requires solving a more general problem (inferring a function) before solving a more specific problem (computing outputs for new cases). 

## Active Learning

In many practical settings we simply cannot afford to label /annotate all $\mathbf x$ for very large $m$, and we need to select the ones that greedily result into the biggest performance metric gain (e.g. accuracy).  Deciding what examples $x$ to label for learning the final hypothesis function is called  [Active learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/active-learning-tutorial-57c3398e34d).  Active learning is useful if the complexity of the underlying target function is localized â€“ labels of some data points are more informative than others.

## Unsupervised Learning 

In unsupervised learning, we present a training set $\{ \mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_m \}$  without labels. The most common unsupervised learning method is clustering. We construct a partition of the data into a number of $K$ **clusters**, such that a suitably chosen loss function is minimized for a *different* set of input data (test).

## Reinforcement Learning

In reinforcement learning, a teacher is not providing a label (as in supervised learning) but rather a reward that judges whether the agent's action results on favorable environment states. In reinforcement learning we can learn end-to-end mappings from perceptions to actions.
