# kNN Workshop

[This](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n-demos/knn/) page allows you to interact with the knn algorithm. Due to its nature, it is highly recommended to spend some time moving data points and understanding the resulting decision regions for a given model complexity (k). Understand the binary L1 classification first and then move to more complicated cases.
