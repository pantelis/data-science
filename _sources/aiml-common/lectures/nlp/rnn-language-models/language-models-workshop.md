# Language Models Workshop

The [following notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pantelis-nlp/tutorial-nlp-notebooks/blob/main/rnn_language_model.ipynb) is a from-scratch attempt on character-level language modeling. Its instructive for you to go through it first and then go through the corresponding language model  in chapter 16 of Geron's book that covers the latest [TF APIs on the subject](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation).
