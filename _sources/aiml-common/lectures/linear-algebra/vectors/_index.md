# Vectors

> Most of the material in this section was borrowed from [this excellent series of Essence of Linear Algebra youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) 

## The Physics, Computer Science and Math perspective on  vectors

## Coordinate systems and vector operations

*Notice the typo - its $[x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2]$*

*$i$ and $j$ are the basis vectors of the xy coordinate system. But these are **not** the only basis vectors that we can have.*

*Every 2D vector can be expressed as a linear combination of two vectors*

![linearly-dependent](images/linearly-dependent.png)
*Not all vectors are good choices for creating a **span**. For example, these two vectors cant span the 2D space - they can only span a single line. $v$ and $w$ are then called linearly dependent.*

![linearly-independent](images/linearly-independent.png)
*These two vectors span the full 2D space - $v$ and $w$ are then called linearly independent.*

*Such set of vectors that are linearly independent and span the full space are called the **basis** vectors of a vector space*
