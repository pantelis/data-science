# Hyperparameter optimization workshop

In this section we will go through a hyperparameter optimization scheme based on grid-search that is seamlessly integrated in Keras. Note that in production environments where training rigs are used either in the cloud or as rigs internally you ought to be in a cloud native platform and use [Katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib) or other compatible to K8s prod environment for this purpose.
