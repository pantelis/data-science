After reading this chapter you should feel familiar with the following ideas and concepts:

1. The wider scope of AI and differences between data mining / machine learning and AI. 
2. The data science ecosystem. 
3. The functional decomposition of the four pipelines needed to power a data intensive business / application. 
4. The complexity behind a real world data pipeline and its tradeoffs (CAP theorem) 
5. The Python language basic APIs in data science projects and a tutorial path for you to dig deeper.
