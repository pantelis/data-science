# Numerical Python (Numpy/Scipy and Pandas) 

## Standard Python

Below is a list of recommended resources you can attend to. We will go over [basic Python](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material/blob/master/tutorials/python/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb). 

The tutorials below are self contained and can remind you the basics in case you need a refresher or you havent done any programming until now. 

1.  [Kaggle Python Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)

2.  [Google Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) This is a bit dated as it covers Python 2, but it is still highly regarded as Python 3 and 2 have few differences.

3. [CodeAcademy Data Science Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science). Take Python modules 4-10. This course contains Numpy and Panda intro as well. 

We should also mentioned [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) as this is perhaps the most popular destination for anyone that wishes to use the skills learned here to launch a software engineering career in tech. It helps you answer all coding-based interview questions. 

## Numpy
We will go [Numpy Tutorial from Stanford's CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/).

## Pandas

In any case, this is the effectively "official" documentation on Pandas: 
[Pandas: powerful Python data analysis toolkit](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/pandas.pdf)
