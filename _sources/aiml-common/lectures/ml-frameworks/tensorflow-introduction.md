title: Introduction to Tensorflow
weighjt: 4
---
This by no means is a tutorial introduction but rather a set of slides that we can use to describe the principle of computational graphs. This can be skipped and consulted later in the course. 

We will cover slides #1 - #28 as shown below.  The slides are from [CS 20: Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/) and despite the title are appropriate for Tensorflow beginners. Slides beyond #28 will be selectively consulted when we go over gradients and backpropagation.
