#  Your study guide after each lecture

## Introduction to Data Science

1. Go through the notes and the what the syllabus says as reading list. 
2. Go through the interactive Python tutorial (IBM is recommended) so you can be ready for next time. 

## Python Refresher

This lecture is mostly to walk through the python implementation of an end to end pipeline. As such it was dry on concepts and difficult to deliver honestly and the elements of the pipeline are many. The book chapter that explains it all will be posted in Discord. You should do the following until the next lecture:

1. Make sure you know how to use the colab environment 
2. Finish the interactive python tutorial
3. Go through the code of the end to end pipeline and make sure you can topologically map the code to the stage of the pipeline. 
4. Review basic probability from the syllabus reading list - I will go through this on Monday as well. 


## The Learning Problem 

This is a very important lecture and you need to 

1. Focus understanding the block diagram that is associated with the supervised learning setting. 
2. Go through the sinusoidal dataset example and make sure you can map the process there to the block diagram. 
3. Understand key terms such as overfitting and regularization. 
4. For those that don't have background in random variables, make sure you run the notebooks / code associated with the ISL Chapter 2 and the chapters mentioned in the syllabus in the GRUS book. 

## Linear Regression and Classification

1. Revisit the regression sinusoidal relationship between x and y and understand what is needed to be learned (the three ingredients for ML are mentioned in the learning problem page). 
2. Make sure you go through the code of GRUS chapter 14 (there was a typo in the syllabus that has been corrected).
3. Spend some time with the Gaussian distribution  and understand how it enters classification and regression problems (in one and two dimensions).

##  Prepare for the midterm

1. Read the notes and the reading list column of the syllabus up to 7/10 (including). 
2. How to read the notes? Spend most of your time on graphs / plots and trying to understand why they behave the way the do.
3. There will be no computational problem in the exam. 

## Trees

1. Make sure you understand what entropy is and what does it offer during the decision tree algorithm.
2. Make sure you can solve computational problems involving simple decision trees.
3. Develop the intuition of how random forests learn and predict during the test phase. 
4. Do not spend considerable amount of time in *gradient* boosting 

## Neural Networks

1. Understand the architecture of a single neuron. 
2. Study the perceptron algorithm and see how SGD is embedded into it. 
3. Play with Tensorflow playground to appreciate what all the parameters are doing. 
4. Conceptually understand what backpropagation is providing to the SGD algorithm.
5. Understand what  CNNs introduce that DNNs could not do efficiently from the perspective of processing unstructured data such as images.
