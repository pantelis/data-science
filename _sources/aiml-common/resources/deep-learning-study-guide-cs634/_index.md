# Study Guide for Deep Learning

**General guidelines**

1. Study from the notes and focus on critically understanding the concepts. 
2. There will be no definition questions e.g. what is a neural network. 
3. There will be no  mathematical derivations (all formulas needed will be given). 
4. Some questions will be computational - make sure you have access to a calculator 
5. Some questions will be multiple choice
6. Some questions will include a figure and you will be asked to explain it. 

**Logistics**

1. Conference in at the time of the exam and turn on your camera. Make sure you are in a place that is quiet and no one will interrupt you.
2. Link to the test will be given to you on Webex, you need to download it and bring it up on the screen. 
3. You need to have empty sheets of paper, pencil / pen and eraser. 
4. Ask clarification questions via conference chat sent to "Everyone" so other can benefit from the responses.  
5. Smartphones will be allowed only at the end to scan your write ups and upload them into canvas. To scan you need to use CamScanner or GeniousScan or any other app of your choice that can generate PDF files of your scans. in your smartphones. 
6. At the end of the exam you will upload into the corresponding Canvas assignment your pdf file(s) **AND** send then by email to the TA. You need to use your University email account for that. 

| Topic    |  What to pay attention to   |
| --- | --- |
|  The learning problem  |  1. Understand how this diagram applies to deep learning.  |
| Backpropagation | 1. You may be given a simple network and ask to backpropagate it | 
|  Scene Understanding   |  1. Understand the Bayesian filter and its elements |
| | 2. Study the computational problem in the RSE section of the notes very well. | 
| | 3. Be prepared to answer questions around localization / tracking. |
| | 4. Understand vanishing gradients and how RESNET helps to overcome them. | 
|   NLP  |  1. What are the stages of an NLP pipeline / what each stage is responsible for. | 
| | 2. You may be given a small corpus and asked how word representations are constructed. |
| | 3. Understand the advantages of RNN over DNNs. |
|  Recommender Systems  |  1. Understand SVD as a general method for dimensionality reduction.   |
|   | 2. Understand what are the differences between PCA and SVD with it comes to dimensionality reduction. |
