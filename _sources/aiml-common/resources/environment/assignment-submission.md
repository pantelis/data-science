# Submitting Your Assignment / Project

## Step 1: Github Repository 

Make sure you know how to commit and push your changes to your repo. If you do not push the latest changes the grader will grade an outdates version of your code. The following steps will only need to be done once - at the beginning of the semester.

1. Go to the settings tab of your repository

4. Open the assignment on the LMS of your institution (Canvas, Brightspace), and enter the copied link into the given textbox.


## Step 2: Colab Notebook

If your assignment includes colab notebooks that will be (obviously) inside your github, you will need to also share them with your grader as they are hosted inside your Google account. You can do this as follows:

1. Navigate to your Colab Notebook and hit the "Share" Button at the top-right:

2. Enter the email of your Grader to share it with them. This will automatically email the notebook link to them as well. Do not share it with the Professor, only the Grader.

3. Hit the "Copy Link" button at the bottom of the dialog. You don't have to enable link sharing if the notebook is already shared with the Grader.

4. Open the assignment on the LMS of your institution (Canvas, Brightspace),  and enter the copied link into the given textbox. 

## How to add the Open in  Colab Button

After adding the TA as a collaborator they will be able to see your code in Github. You need to add a "Open in Colab" button in your Github. When after clicking on it they will directed to the code on your Google Colab. Following are the steps :

1. Add a Text Markdown on the Start of your code in Google Colab just like below.

2. After Adding a Markdown section you need to add the following link to the same. Check the image. Also please note that in this link
instead of "https://github.com/dhruvilk/Course-Assignments/tree/main/Sample.ipynb" you need to add the location of the notebook in which your code is present. Your notebook will be in your Github. So copy the link and paste it above. Rest will stay the same.

3. After adding the link upload the file to your Github. You will get the following results. Once clicked on "Open in Colab" button it will direct the TA to the code on your Colab notebook.

The following video is also useful on how to add the Open in Colab button in notebooks but also in a browser bookmark. The later is helpful when the notebook does not have the embedded button.
