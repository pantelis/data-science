# Study Guide 

**General guidelines**

1. Study from the notes and focus on critically understanding the concepts. 
2. There will be no definition questions e.g. what is a neural network. 
3. There will be no  mathematical derivations (all formulas needed will be given). 
4. Some questions will be computational - make sure you have access to a calculator 
5. Some questions will be multiple choice
6. Some questions will include a figure and you will be asked to explain it. 

**Logistics**

1. Conference in at the time of the exam and turn on your camera. Make sure you are in a place that is quiet and no one will interrupt you.
2. Link to the test will be given to you on Webex, you need to download it and bring it up on the screen. 
3. You need to have empty sheets of paper, pencil / pen and eraser. 
4. Ask clarification questions via conference chat sent to "Everyone" so other can benefit from the responses.  
5. Smartphones will be allowed only at the end to scan your write ups and upload them into canvas. To scan you need to use CamScanner or GeniousScan or any other app of your choice that can generate PDF files of your scans. in your smartphones. 
6. At the end of the exam you will upload into the corresponding Canvas assignment your pdf file(s) **AND** send then by email to the TA. You need to use your University email account for that. 

| Topic    |  What to pay attention to   |
| --- | --- |
| Decision Trees | You may be asked to solve a computational problem involving decision trees. Know how to calculate entropy and IG as you go down splits. | 
|  Bayes rule | You may be asked to solve a computational problem similar to the one in the notes but not identical | 
|  The learning problem  |  1. Understand how this diagram applies to deep learning.  |
| Back-propagation | 1. You may be asked to explain the behavior of the gradient as it passes through certain gates |
| Clustering | You may be asked a visual K-means question, so make sure you understand how the alg works |  
|  Dimensionality Reduction   |  Understand the differences of SVD and PCA with respect to picking the reduced dimensions | 
|  Scene Understanding   |  Understand vanishing gradients and how RESNET helps to overcome them. | 
|   NLP  |  You may be given a small corpus and asked how word representations are constructed. |
