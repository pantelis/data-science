# Study Guide for Classical ML

**General guidelines**

1. Study from the notes and focus on critically understanding the concepts. 
2. There will be no definition questions e.g. what is a decision tree. 
3. There will be no  mathematical derivations (all formulas needed will be given). 
4. Some questions will be computational - make sure you have access to a calculator 
5. Some questions will be multiple choice
6. Some questions will include a figure and you will be asked to explain it. 

**Logistics**

1. Conference in at the time of the exam and turn on your camera. Make sure you are in a place that is quiet and no one will interrupt you.
2. Link to the test will be given to you on Webex, you need to download it and bring it up on the screen. 
3. You need to have empty sheets of paper, pencil / pen and eraser. 
4. Ask clarification questions via conference chat sent to "Everyone" so other can benefit from the responses.  
5. Smartphones will be allowed only at the end to scan your write ups and upload them into canvas. To scan you need to use CamScanner or GeniousScan or any other app of your choice that can generate PDF files of your scans. in your smartphones. 
6. At the end of the exam you will upload into the corresponding Canvas assignment your pdf file(s) **AND** send then by email to the TA. You need to use your University email account for that. 

| Topic    |  What to pay attention to   |
| --- | --- |
|  The learning problem   |  1. Understand the block diagram without the math.   2. Review the various forms of learning.  |
|   Linear Regression  | 2.  Understand the three ingredients needed for learning 2. Understand what is regularization and how overfiting is manifested.    |
|   Classification  |  1. Understand the problem setting and especially the metrics.    |
|   Bayesian Statistics  |  1. Understand the Bayes rule and how it is used in interpreting test outcomes.  |
|   Optimization  |  1. Pay close attention how the gradient descent works and its behavior as it searches the space of weights.      |
|     | 1. Be prepared to answer questions related to all the methods. For example in the figure why the boundary of the decision tree is the way it is. |
