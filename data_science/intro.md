## What this course is all about  

This course is all about making you love data science. Data science is by definition is multidisciplinary area as you will be dealing with problems that exist in a specific vertical / industry and you ought to understand what the data mean for each domain.  In this course we will challenge you with exciting data-intensive problems and teach you from the ground up the concepts that will allow you to capture, transform, model and report in Python notebooks their solutions.  The iterative nature of data science is to perhaps the most important meta-pattern - you need to learn how to iterate efficiently. This course requires some intensive effort from your side in both learning these concepts and practicing them in your assigned projects. We hope that we will motivate you to work hard and have some fun along the way.
